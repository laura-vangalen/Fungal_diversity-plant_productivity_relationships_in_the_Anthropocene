This repository contains the R code used to conduct the analyses and make figures for the publication "Fungal diversityâ€“plant productivity relationships in the Anthropocene". Values from 10,000 random global grid cells were extracted for use in the analyses ("raster_sample1.rds"). All original raster layers are publicly available elswhere (see manuscript Materials and Methods).
